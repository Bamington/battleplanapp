# Battleplan App

A React-based application for tracking miniatures and booking gaming tables.

## Build Timestamp Feature

The app automatically displays the last build timestamp on the login screen. This timestamp is updated automatically whenever you run:

- `npm run dev` - Updates timestamp and starts development server
- `npm run build` - Updates timestamp and builds for production
- `npm run update-timestamp` - Updates timestamp only

The timestamp shows the date and time when the code was last modified and built.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```
